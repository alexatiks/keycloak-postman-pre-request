# Postman pre-request script for authentication with Keycloak

FORK: Adding skip when token has not expired.

This is a javascript-Script for use with [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)'s pre-request script feature.
It makes POST request to [Keycloak Token Endpoint](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/#_service_overview) to
get a valid token and automatically set the token for all requests in Postman collection.
This will enable to make request as if a logged in user would make them to an API. 

## Usage

1. Create a new client in Keycloak. This client is mostly default. Important are just these few:

*  Client ID: _Choose a name_
*  Client Protocol: openid-connect
*  Access Type: confidential
*  Valid Redirect URIs: http://localhost:8080/*

This client will only be used for Postman then. Btw. donÂ´t forget to hit "save".

2. Go now into the second tab "Credentials" of your new created Client. Here you can find the Clientsecret in the field *Secret*. Copy that to you clipboard.

</p>

3. Now head on to Postman. Create a new collection. Every query you want to make to the API which is protected by Keycloak, has to be in this collection then. On a already existing collection click edit (behind the 3 vertical dots). In the new appearing window choose a name and copy the content of [keycloak-fetch-token-postman-pre-request.js](keycloak-fetch-token-postman-pre-request.js) into the "Pre-request Script" tab in Postman. No fill in all the variables in the beginning of the script. Remember you already copied the Clientsecret. If you dont know a variable, some of them can be found in Keycloak under the previously created Client and then in the tab *Installation*. In the screenshot below you can see an example. These are my development values. *Never post production clientsecrets or something!* With username and password you can choose a user. This is good for testing roles. Leave the rest as is.

</p>

4. In the Authorization tab set the Type to Bearer Token and Token to *{{token}}*. This is the token that get send back from Keycloak via the pre-request script.

5. For all API requests: In the Authorization tab select Type - Inherit auth from parent. You can see an example below. Keep in mind that the queries you want to execute has to be saved into the configured collection
